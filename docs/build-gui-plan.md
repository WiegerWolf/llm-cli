# High-Level Plan: Adding a GUI Frontend

## 1. Goal

The primary goal is to add a graphical user interface (GUI) as an alternative frontend to the existing command-line interface (CLI). Both interfaces should coexist and utilize the core application logic encapsulated in `ChatClient` and associated tools. The existing `UserInterface` abstraction will be leveraged to minimize changes to the core logic.

## 2. Key Steps

### 2.1. Choose a GUI Toolkit

*   **Decision:** Select a suitable C++ GUI toolkit (e.g., Qt, wxWidgets, ImGui, GTKmm).
*   **Considerations:** Cross-platform compatibility, ease of use, licensing, dependency management, community support, and visual requirements. The choice will significantly impact development and build complexity.

### 2.2. Update Project Structure

*   Create a new directory (e.g., `gui_interface/`) for GUI-specific code.
*   Implement a new class `GuiInterface` derived from the abstract `UserInterface` base class (`ui_interface.h`).
*   Modify `main.cpp` or create a new entry point (`gui_main.cpp`?) to allow launching the application in either CLI or GUI mode (e.g., based on a command-line argument like `--gui`).

### 2.3. Adapt Build System (CMake)

*   Modify `CMakeLists.txt` to:
    *   Find the chosen GUI toolkit libraries and headers.
    *   Conditionally compile the `GuiInterface` implementation and link against the GUI library. This could be controlled by a CMake option (e.g., `-DBUILD_GUI=ON`).
    *   Handle potential platform-specific requirements for the GUI toolkit.

### 2.4. Implement `GuiInterface`

*   Implement all virtual methods defined in `UserInterface`:
    *   `initialize()`: Create and show the main application window, input fields, output areas, status bar, etc.
    *   `shutdown()`: Perform GUI cleanup.
    *   `promptUserInput()`: This will likely need adaptation. Instead of blocking, the GUI's "Send" button click event will trigger the processing. This method might signal the core logic that input is ready or be bypassed entirely by an event-driven approach.
    *   `displayOutput()`: Append assistant messages to the main chat view/text area.
    *   `displayError()`: Show error messages (e.g., in a popup, status bar, or dedicated error view).
    *   `displayStatus()`: Update a status bar or designated area with status messages.
*   **Threading:** GUI operations must run on the main GUI thread. Long-running tasks (API calls, tool execution in `ChatClient`) must be executed in background threads to prevent freezing the UI. Mechanisms like signals/slots (Qt), event posting, or callbacks will be needed to safely communicate between the `ChatClient`'s thread and the GUI thread.

### 2.5. Adapt Core Logic Integration

*   The `ChatClient` constructor already accepts a `UserInterface&`, which is good.
*   The main challenge lies in adapting the synchronous `ChatClient::run` loop. In a GUI, the application is typically event-driven. The GUI will likely initiate calls to `ChatClient::processTurn` (or a similar method) in response to user actions (e.g., clicking "Send"). `ChatClient` might need adjustments to work within an event loop or manage its state differently.

### 2.6. Packaging and Installation

*   Update installation scripts (`install.sh`, CMake `install` commands) to include any necessary GUI library runtime components or assets.

## 3. Next Steps

*   Decide on the GUI toolkit.
*   Refine the plan with more specific details based on the chosen toolkit.
*   Start implementing the build system changes and the basic `GuiInterface` structure.
