# Part V: General and Error Handling - Detailed Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing Part V: General and Error Handling for the "Dynamic Model Fetching, Caching, Selection, and Metadata" feature.

## I. Initial Model Handling

**Requirement**: Use `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` on first launch or if API is unavailable.

**Affected Areas**:
*   Application startup sequence (e.g., `main_cli.cpp`, `main_gui.cpp`)
*   Configuration loading/saving mechanism
*   `ChatClient` or equivalent class
*   Error handling for API unavailability

**Plan Steps**:

1.  **Define `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID`**:
    *   [ ] Ensure `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` is clearly defined as a constant (e.g., in `config.h.in` or a dedicated configuration header/source file).
2.  **Startup Logic Modification**:
    *   [ ] Modify application startup to attempt fetching models from the API.
    *   [ ] If API fetch fails (timeout, network error, etc.), log the error appropriately.
    *   [ ] In case of API failure, or if it's the determined "first launch" (e.g., no previously selected/cached valid model), load and use `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID`.
    *   [ ] Clarify behavior if a previously selected/cached model exists but API is unavailable (likely use cached, but confirm interaction with other feature parts).
3.  **`ChatClient` Integration**:
    *   [ ] Ensure `ChatClient` (or equivalent) can be initialized with or can fall back to using `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID`.
    *   [ ] Implement logic in `ChatClient` to use `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` if the currently selected model becomes invalid or unavailable and subsequent API calls to refresh/re-fetch also fail.
4.  **User Notification/Logging**:
    *   [ ] If `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` is used due to API unavailability or first launch without API access, provide a clear notification to the user (e.g., status bar message in GUI, console message in CLI) indicating that a default model is in use and, if possible, the reason.
    *   [ ] Ensure relevant events (e.g., "API unavailable, using default model") are logged for debugging.

## II. Asynchronous Operations and UI Feedback

**Requirement**: Ensure API fetching/caching are asynchronous. Provide UI feedback (e.g., "Loading models...").

**Affected Areas**:
*   `ChatClient` (API interaction methods)
*   GUI layer (e.g., `main_gui.cpp`, relevant UI components)
*   CLI layer (e.g., `cli_interface.cpp`) for feedback if applicable
*   Threading/asynchronous task management utilities

**Plan Steps**:

1.  **Asynchronous API Calls**:
    *   [ ] Review all API calls within `ChatClient` related to model fetching, caching, and metadata retrieval.
    *   [ ] Ensure these operations are performed on separate threads or utilize an existing asynchronous task manager to prevent UI (GUI/CLI) blocking.
    *   [ ] Implement robust callback mechanisms, futures/promises, or event-based systems to handle results (success/data) and errors from these asynchronous operations.
2.  **UI Feedback Implementation (GUI)**:
    *   [ ] Identify or design UI elements for feedback (e.g., a dedicated status bar section, a modal "loading" overlay, or an indicator near the model selection UI).
    *   [ ] When an asynchronous model-related API call is initiated:
        *   [ ] Display a clear "Loading models..." or similar message.
        *   [ ] Consider disabling relevant UI controls (e.g., model selection dropdown, chat input if model-dependent) to prevent inconsistent states or user actions during loading.
    *   [ ] Upon successful completion of the API call:
        *   [ ] Hide/remove the loading message/indicator.
        *   [ ] Update the UI with the new model data (e.g., populate/refresh the model list).
        *   [ ] Re-enable any previously disabled UI controls.
    *   [ ] Upon failure of the API call:
        *   [ ] Hide/remove the loading message/indicator.
        *   [ ] Display an appropriate, user-friendly error message (e.g., "Failed to load models. Using default/cached configuration." or "Check network connection.").
        *   [ ] Re-enable UI controls, ensuring the application is in a stable fallback state (e.g., using default model, or previously cached models).
3.  **UI Feedback Implementation (CLI)**:
    *   [ ] For the CLI version, print informative messages to the console, such as:
        *   [ ] "Fetching models from API..."
        *   [ ] "Models loaded successfully." or "Updated model list."
        *   [ ] "Error fetching models: [brief error description]. Using default/cached models."
4.  **State Management for UI Feedback**:
    *   [ ] Implement or utilize existing state variables (e.g., `bool isLoadingModels;`) within the GUI's state management or `ChatClient` to track the loading status.
    *   [ ] This state will drive the display/hiding of UI feedback elements and enabling/disabling of controls.

## III. Testing

**Requirement**: Test all new functionalities and error scenarios related to the entire "Dynamic Model Fetching, Caching, Selection, and Metadata" feature, with a focus on aspects covered in Part V.

**Affected Areas**: All components involved in the feature, including `ChatClient`, UI (GUI/CLI), startup logic, caching mechanisms, and API interaction points.

**Plan Steps (General Testing Strategy)**:

1.  **Unit Tests**:
    *   [ ] **Initial Model Handling (`DEFAULT_MODEL_ID`)**:
        *   [ ] Test application startup logic:
            *   [ ] Scenario: First launch (no prior configuration/cache) AND API available: Verify behavior (e.g., fetches, might use API default or `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` if API provides no initial default).
            *   [ ] Scenario: First launch AND API unavailable: Verify `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` is loaded and an appropriate error/notification is logged/shown.
            *   [ ] Scenario: Subsequent launch, API unavailable, cached model exists: Verify cached model is used.
            *   [ ] Scenario: Subsequent launch, API unavailable, cached model invalid/unavailable: Verify fallback to `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID`.
        *   [ ] Test `ChatClient`:
            *   [ ] Verify fallback to `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` if a selected model becomes invalid during runtime and re-fetch fails.
    *   [ ] **Asynchronous Operations (`ChatClient`)**:
        *   [ ] Mock API interactions to test asynchronous execution of model fetching/caching methods.
        *   [ ] Verify correct handling of success (data processing) and error (error propagation/handling) callbacks/futures.
        *   [ ] Ensure no deadlocks or race conditions in async logic.
2.  **Integration Tests**:
    *   [ ] **Full Feature Flow**:
        *   [ ] Test the end-to-end process: API available -> models fetched -> models cached -> model selected by user -> model used for operations.
    *   [ ] **API Unavailability Scenarios**:
        *   [ ] Test application startup with API down: Verify fallback to `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` (or cached if available and valid) and correct UI/CLI notification.
        *   [ ] Test API going down during an active session when a model refresh/fetch is attempted: Verify graceful error handling, UI feedback, and potential fallback.
    *   [ ] **UI Feedback Verification (GUI & CLI)**:
        *   [ ] Manually verify (or use UI automation tools if available for GUI) that "Loading models..." messages (or equivalents) appear during API calls and disappear upon completion/failure.
        *   [ ] Verify UI controls are appropriately disabled/enabled during these asynchronous operations in the GUI.
        *   [ ] Confirm error messages are clearly displayed to the user in both GUI and CLI for API failures or other issues.
3.  **Specific Error Scenario Testing (Focus on Part V)**:
    *   [ ] **Network Conditions**:
        *   [ ] Simulate complete network failure: Test `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` usage, error messages.
        *   [ ] Simulate API request timeouts: Test asynchronous handling, UI feedback, and timeout error messages.
        *   [ ] Simulate intermittent network connectivity.
    *   [ ] **API Response Issues**:
        *   [ ] Simulate API returning malformed JSON/data: Test error parsing and graceful failure.
        *   [ ] Simulate API returning an empty list of models: Test how the application handles this (e.g., uses default, informs user).
        *   [ ] Simulate API returning error codes (e.g., 401, 403, 500): Test appropriate error handling and user feedback.
    *   [ ] **`DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` Configuration**:
        *   [ ] Test scenario: `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` is defined but the corresponding model details are missing locally (if it relies on local fallbacks beyond just an ID). This might be more of a packaging/config validation.
4.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Scenarios**:
    *   [ ] Scenario: User launches the application for the very first time.
        *   Expected: Clear indication of model loading if API call is made; if API fails, `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` is used with a notification.
    *   [ ] Scenario: User launches with no internet connection.
        *   Expected: Application uses `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` (or valid cached model) and informs the user about the offline status/default usage.
    *   [ ] Scenario: User observes the model fetching process.
        *   Expected: "Loading..." feedback is visible and disappears once models are loaded or an error occurs.
    *   [ ] Scenario: User attempts to interact with model-dependent features while models are loading.
        *   Expected: UI elements are disabled or provide feedback that loading is in progress.
    *   [ ] Scenario: An error occurs during model fetching (e.g., server error).
        *   Expected: A user-friendly error message is displayed, and the application remains stable, possibly falling back to a default or cached state.
5.  **Test Documentation**:
    *   [ ] Create and maintain a list of test cases covering all functionalities, error conditions, and UAT scenarios.
    *   [ ] Document the steps to reproduce each test case and the expected outcomes.
    *   [ ] Record test results and track any identified bugs or issues.
