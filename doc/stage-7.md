# Refactoring Stage 7: Finalize Entry Point and Cleanup

**Goal:** Ensure `main.cpp` correctly manages the UI lifecycle and remove any remaining unused includes related to direct I/O.

**Prerequisites:** Stage 6 completed. All direct user-facing I/O goes through the `UserInterface`.

**Checklist:**

1.  [X] **Review `main.cpp`:**
    *   [X] Verify `CliInterface cli_ui;` is created before `ChatClient`.
    *   [X] Verify `cli_ui.initialize();` is called before `client.run()`.
    *   [X] Verify `ChatClient client(cli_ui);` correctly injects the UI.
    *   [X] Verify `client.run();` is called within the `try` block.
    *   [X] Verify `cli_ui.shutdown();` is called before the program exits (e.g., after the `try`/`catch` block or before `return 0`).
    *   [X] Verify `catch` blocks use `cli_ui.displayError` with `std::cerr` fallback.
    *   [X] Remove redundant `#include <iostream>` and other includes. Replace final `std::cout` with `cli_ui.displayOutput("\nExiting...\n");`.
2.  [X] **Review Includes Across Project:**
    *   [X] Double-check all modified `.cpp` files (`main.cpp`, `chat_client.cpp`, `tools.cpp`, `tools_impl/*.cpp`, `cli_interface.cpp`) for any remaining `#include <iostream>` that are no longer necessary (i.e., all `std::cout`/`cerr` replaced by `ui` calls or deemed acceptable like fatal errors in `main` or specific warnings like static CURL handle init failure). Removed commented-out `std::cout`/`std::cerr` lines.
    *   [X] Double-check for stray `readline` includes (removed from `chat_client.cpp`). `cstdlib` kept where needed (`getenv`, `free`).
3.  [X] **Review `CMakeLists.txt`:**
    *   [X] Confirm all necessary source files (`cli_interface.cpp`, etc.) are listed.
    *   [X] Confirm necessary libraries (`Readline`, `Threads`, `CURL`, etc.) are linked.
    *   [X] Confirm include directories are correctly set.
4.  [X] **Build & Verify:**
    *   [X] Run `./build.sh`. Ensure clean compilation without warnings about unused variables or includes if possible. (Verified fc92a09)
    *   [X] Run `./build/llm`. Perform a quick smoke test to ensure basic functionality remains. (Verified fc92a09)
