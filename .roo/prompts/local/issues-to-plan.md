I have a couple of bugs in my gui window.

in oder to tackle these issues, i want you to write down a new docs/issues.md file with general outline of the work we're about to do. then we'll work on this plan later. no code changes for now. just read the code as you need and decide what to do


now, let's work step by step on each isue. your job is to pick each issue from the @/docs/issues.md  and use coder to find and read relevant files to fix the issue, then come up with a plan to fix it, and then to write down this plan as docs/issue-<num>.md as a checklist with detailed instrutions, so we can pick it up later and fix it. we're at the planning stage now. so no code changes, just documenting the work that need to be done
