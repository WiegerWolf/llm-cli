i'm implementing a big feature, your job is to pick each step from the @/docs/currentFeature.md   and use coder to find and read relevant files to implement the step, then come up with a plan to do it, and then to write down this plan as docs/step-<num>.md as a checklist with detailed instrutions, so we can pick it up later and work on it. we're at the planning stage now. so no code changes, just documenting the work that need to be done
