I have this PR in my repo https://github.com/WiegerWolf/llm-cli/pull/###

I want you to do this: your first task for coder should be to use the mcp tools from github you have available to get the PR description and a list of unresolved code review comments from it. only return code review comments that are unresolved. there's a bunch of them from the most recent review pass. only get the latest review comments that are not yet has been adressed

then I want you to read each unadressed comment and decide if it aligns with the PR goal and if it's worth implementing. keep in mind that we don't know if reviewer is always right. use your own judgement

then I want you to start making tasks for the worthy tickets and tackle them one by one using coder.
