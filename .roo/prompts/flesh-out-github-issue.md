your job is to pick earliest unsolved issue from my repo at https://github.com/WiegerWolf/llm-cli/issues using tools that you have (list_issues(sort:updated direction:asc state:open)). 

then you need to get the issue using the github tools that you have (get_issue, get_issue_comments) and read what the issue is about

then use coder to find and read relevant files to fix the issue, then come up with a plan to fix it

and then to write down this plan, updating the issue title and description using the tools that you have (update_issue); the plan should be as a checklist with detailed instrutions, so we can pick it up later and fix it. 

we're at the planning stage now. so no code changes, just documenting the work that need to be done
